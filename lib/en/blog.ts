      <p>In the interview published on <strong>January 28, 2025</strong>, DND Cyprus shared insights on its standout projects and future goals that embody the “USA Quality in Cyprus” approach shaping Iskele’s rising profile. The discussion emphasized how design, functionality, and environmental harmony are integrated into every DND project.

      <p>The company continues to set new standards in projects such as <em>La Joya</em>, <em>La Joya Perla</em>, and <em>La Joya Perla II</em> — where horizontal architecture, natural landscaping, beach/club concepts, and social amenities that evoke a “holiday feeling every day” are essential features. Smart home infrastructure, heating/cooling systems, and high insulation standards are also among the key quality components.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vision:</strong> Not just developing residences, but enhancing regional lifestyles through mixed investments focused on wellness, tourism, and education.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Environmental awareness through landscape design compatible with local flora, and water and waste management practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Community:</strong> A sense of belonging blending “local and global living” through beach clubs and social facilities.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The DND team also emphasized that while investor interest in Northern Cyprus is increasing, infrastructure development remains critical for the sector. They believe close coordination with local authorities will accelerate lasting solutions.
